     This file contains instructions on how to make CLX work with Franz
Common Lisp.  CLX should work on any machine that supports Allegro Common
Lisp version 3.0.1 or greater.  It also works under ExCL version 2.0.10.
However it has been tested extensively with only Allegro CL versions 3.0,
3.1, and 4.0.

     There are three steps to compile and install CLX.  The first is simply
moving files around.  In this directory, execute (assuming you using csh):

% foreach i (*.l */*.l)
? mv $i $i:r.cl
? end
% mv exclMakefile Makefile

     The second is compiling the source files into fasl files.  The fasl files
will be combined into one big fasl file, CLX.fasl.  This file is then installed
in your Common Lisp library directory in the next step.  You may need to edit
the Makefile to select the proper CFLAGS for your machine -- look in Makefile
for examples.  Then just:

% make

     Now you must move the CLX.fasl file into the standard CL library.
This is normally "/usr/local/lib/cl/code", but you can find out for sure
by typing:

<cl> (directory-namestring excl::*library-code-pathname*)

to a running Lisp.  If it prints something other than "/usr/local/lib/cl/code"
substitute what it prints in the below instructions.

% mv CLX.fasl /usr/local/lib/cl/code/clx.fasl
% mv *.o /usr/local/lib/cl/code

Now you can just start up Lisp and type:

<cl> (load "clx")

to load in CLX.  You may want to dump a lisp at this point since CLX is a large
package and can take some time to load into Lisp.  You probably also want to
set the :generation-spread to 1 while loading CLX.  Please see your Allegro CL
User Guide for more information on :generation-spread.


     Sophisticated users may wish to peruse the Makefile and defsystem.cl
and note how things are set up.  For example we hardwire the compiler
interrupt check switch on, so that CL can still be interrupted while it
is reading from the X11 socket.  Please see chapter 7 of the CL User's
guide for more information on compiler switches and their effects.

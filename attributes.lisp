;;;	The special variable *window-attributes* is an alist containg:
;;;	(drawable attributes attribute-changes geometry geometry-changes)
;;;	Where DRAWABLE is the associated window or pixmap
;;;	      ATTRIBUTES is NIL or a reply-buffer containing the drawable's
;;;		         attributes for use by the accessors.
;;;	      ATTRIBUTE-CHANGES is NIL or an array.  The first element
;;;			 of the array is a "value-mask", indicating which
;;;			 attributes have changed.  The other elements are
;;;			 integers associated with the changed values, ready
;;;			 for insertion into a server request.
;;;	      GEOMETRY is like ATTRIBUTES, but for window geometry
;;;	      GEOMETRY-CHANGES is like ATTRIBUTE-CHANGES, but for window geometry
;;;
;;;	Attribute and Geometry accessors and SETF's look on the special variable
;;;	*window-attributes* for the drawable.  If its not there, the accessor is
;;;     NOT within a WITH-STATE, and a server request is made to get or put a value.
;;;     If an entry is found in *window-attributes*, the cache buffers are used
;;;	for the access.
;;;
;;;	All WITH-STATE has to do (re)bind *Window-attributes* to a list including
;;;	the new drawable.  The caches are initialized to NIL and allocated as needed.

This directory contains CLX, an X11 client library for Common
Lisp. The code was originally taken from a CMUCL distribution, was
modified somewhat in order to make it compile and run under SBCL, then
a selection of patches were added from other CLXes around the net.

= Features

 - SHAPE extension support (Gilbert Baumann)
 - X authority support that works with ssh forwarding (Eric Marsden via CMUCL)
 - OPEN-DEFAULT-DISPLAY function, as the name suggests, does that (dan)
 - various bug fixes (Iban Hatchondo and a cast of several)

= Building

0. You need SBCL 0.7.13 or any later release

1. Untar this tree somewhere

2. Add a symlink to clx.asd from one of the directories listed in your
   asdf:*central-registry*

   If that makes no sense to you yet, choose one of -

   2a. personal installation:

     $ cd $HOME/.sbcl/systems # you may have to create this directory
     $ ln -s /path/to/clx/source/clx.asd .

   2b. systemwide installations: you need to ask SBCL where it lives

     $ sbcl --noinform --eval '(format t "~A~%" (posix-getenv "SBCL_HOME"))' </dev/null
     /usr/local/lib/sbcl/
     * 
     $ cd /usr/local/lib/sbcl/site-systems
     $ ln -s /path/to/clx/source/clx.asd .

3. 
   * (require 'asdf)
   * (require 'clx)

This will load all the files, after compiling anything that needs compiling

4. To test CLX (and get a small amount of Lisp advocacy), try loading
the file "demo/menu", and then executing the function
xlib::just-say-lisp.

   * (load "clx/demo/menu")
   * (xlib::just-say-lisp)

5. If you're new to Lisp, be advised that despite the examples in
demo/, it's generally /not/ considered good style to switch to the
:xlib package and write your code in it.  Spend some time with a
language reference to familiarize yourself with USE-PACKAGE, or 
better yet, the USE option to DEFPACKAGE


= Known problems:

(none reported)

 
= Bug reports, new features, patches

The best place to send bug reports, especially if you can verify that
some other CLX port (e.g. CMUCL's) also has the problem, is to the
portable-clx-devel list

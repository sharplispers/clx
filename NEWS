experimental RENDER extension support (from Gilbert Baumann)
  note: the API to this is as yet unfinalized, as indeed the protocol
        and specification appear to be in flux.  Nevertheless,
        feedback is welcome to the portable-clx-devel mailing list.

Bug fixes

 * fix bugs in the image test: always draw glyphs in white on black
   (not 1 on 0 -- i.e. dark red/blue on black in 24 bit truecolour);
   don't abuse the X-HOT and Y-HOT slots for communicating persistent
   information any more.  

 * Disable the "optimized" pixarray read/write routines, on the basis
   that the newly fixed image test reveals that they are broken.

 * fix type bugs in DEFINE-GCONTEXT-ACCESSOR, which previously
   signalled a type error if :COPY-FUNCTION was not provided, and a
   different type error if it was.

Other notes

 * we use the SBCL extensions to the condition system to customize
   compiler behaviour.  As such, the system will only build without
   breaking into the debugger using the supplied .asd, as we inhibit
   error signalling from DEFCONSTANT; the benefits of this are easier
   code sharing, as we minimize divergence within the clx source
   proper from other implementations.

 * we also use an SBCL extension to maximize efficiency: we set
   SB-EXT:*DERIVE-FUNCTION-TYPES* to true for the duration of the
   compilation of the clx library.  Should functions in CLX be
   redefined in a type-incompatible way, their callers in CLX (but not
   outside) will need to be recompiled.

OPEN-DEFAULT-DISPLAY (opens display in $DISPLAY environment variable) exported

Implement CLX MP dependencies for SBCL: HOLDING-LOCK, PROCESS-BLOCK, etc

Many bug fixes

 * asking for text extents on unchached fonts could potentially deadlock
   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.clx.devel/16

 * lots of compiler warnings, style-warnings, notes cleared up


Style and ANSI cleanups

 * Much renaming of constants from *foo* to +foo+

 *  Change old-style COMPILE LOAD EVAL to new-style :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL
     :LOAD-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE in EVAL-WHENs.

Changes in SBCL CLX 0.5.1, XXX FILL THIS IN XXX

experimental RENDER extension support (from Gilbert Baumann)
  note: the API to this is as yet unfinalized, as indeed the protocol
        and specification appear to be in flux.  Nevertheless,
        feedback is welcome to the portable-clx-devel mailing list.

Bug fixes

 * fix bugs in the image test: always draw glyphs in white on black
   (not 1 on 0 -- i.e. dark red/blue on black in 24 bit truecolour);
   don't abuse the X-HOT and Y-HOT slots for communicating persistent
   information any more.  Disable the "optimized" pixarray read/write
   routines, on the basis that the newly fixed image test reveals that
   they are broken.

Many bug fixes

 * asking for text extents on unchached fonts could potentially deadlock
   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.clx.devel/16

 * lots of compiler warnings, style-warnings, notes cleared up


Style and ANSI cleanups

 * Much renaming of constants from *foo* to +foo+

 *  Change old-style COMPILE LOAD EVAL to new-style :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL
     :LOAD-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE in EVAL-WHENs.

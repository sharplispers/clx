XFREE86-VIDMODE extension support (courtesy of Iban Hatchondo)

OPEN-DEFAULT-DISPLAY (opens display in $DISPLAY environment variable) exported

Implement CLX MP dependencies for SBCL: HOLDING-LOCK, PROCESS-BLOCK, etc

Many bug fixes

 * asking for text extents on unchached fonts could potentially deadlock
   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.clx.devel/16

 * lots of compiler warnings, style-warnings, notes cleared up


Style and ANSI cleanups

 * Much renaming of constants from *foo* to +foo+

 *  Change old-style COMPILE LOAD EVAL to new-style :COMPILE-TOPLEVEL
     :LOAD-TOPLEVEL :EXECUTE in EVAL-WHENs.

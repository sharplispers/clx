;;; This is a pretty direct translation of the Xlib selection test
;;; program by Tor Andersson found at
;;; <http://ghostscript.com/~tor/repos/Klipp/x11clipboard.c>, with
;;; minor enhancements:
;;;
;;; * gdk requestors apparently unconditionally request UTF8_STRING
;;;   selections without checking the TARGETS list of the selection
;;;   owner -- and apparently even never request anything else.  This
;;;   seems to be in contradiction with the freedesktop.org draft
;;;   specification at
;;;   <http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~jch/software/UTF8_STRING/UTF8_STRING.text>
;;;   (linked from <http://freedesktop.org/Standards>), but this is
;;;   the real world and we have to live in it.  It would be nice if
;;;   someone in the freedesktop community could resolve this.
;;;
;;; * the original C code, in the XSendEvent call, has an event mask
;;;   of SelectionNotify.  SelectionNotify is not an event mask at
;;;   all, however: but the code works "by accident" because
;;;   SelectionNotify happens to have value 31, which has enough bits
;;;   flipped on that most clients select on at least one of those
;;;   events.  This bug is fixed below.
;;;
;;; * [ Update 2004-11-29, superseding to some extent the above ] in
;;;   fact, these two things are related.  ICCCM says that the event
;;;   disclaiming the ability to send in a given format should be sent
;;;   with an empty event mask ("2.2 Responsibilities of the Selection
;;;   Owner").
;;;
;;; As ever with these things, the divisions in intellectual property
;;; between the writer of the original C program, Tor Andersson
;;; (contactable at tor [dot] andersson [at] gmail [dot] com) and the
;;; translator (Christophe Rhodes, csr21 [at] cam [dot] ac [dot] uk)
;;; are murky, probably depend on jurisdiction, and in addition for
;;; such a small work are essentially trivial.  To set peoples' minds
;;; at ease, Tor wishes this information to be disseminated as widely
;;; as possible.

Changes in CLX 5.02:

Replace LCL:ENVIRONMENT-VALUE with LCL:ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLE.

Quote type argument to TYPE-CHECK consistently.


Changes in CLX 5.01:

Support for MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 authorization has been added.

All VALUES declarations have been changed to CLX-VALUES declarations.
VALUES is a CL type name and cannot be used as a declaration name.

needs them.

Many type declarations have been corrected or tightened up now that some
Lisps look at them.

Print functions have been defined for bitmap and pixmap formats.

The DISPLAY-PLIST slot will be initialized to NIL.

When debugging, don't optimize SPEED in the buffer macros.

Make the CARD8<->CHAR and the window manager code work for sparse
character sets (where some codes do not have corresponding characters).

correct number of arguments.

PUT-IMAGE will now work for 24-bit images.

The buffer accessors for MEMBER8, etc., will use the standard mechanisms
for reporting type errors.

Typographical errors in SET-WM-PROPERTIES, SET-STANDARD-COLORMAP, and
POINTER-CONTROL have been fixed.

A variety of changes for Symbolics Minima systems have been made.

Some system-dependent code has been added for CMU Common Lisp.

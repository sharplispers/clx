;; Types employed: display, window, pixmap, cursor, font, gcontext, colormap, color.
;; These types are defined solely by a functional interface; we do not specify
;; whether they are implemented as structures or flavors or ...  Although functions
;; below are written using DEFUN, this is not an implementation requirement (although
;; it is a requirement that they be functions as opposed to macros or special forms).
;; It is unclear whether with-slots in the Common Lisp Object System must work on
;; them.

;; Windows, pixmaps, cursors, fonts, gcontexts, and colormaps are all represented as
;; compound objects, rather than as integer resource-ids.  This allows applications
;; to deal with multiple displays without having an explicit display argument in the
;; most common functions.  Every function uses the display object indicated by the
;; first argument that is or contains a display; it is an error if arguments contain
;; different displays, and predictable results are not guaranteed.

;; Each of window, pixmap, drawable, cursor, font, gcontext, and colormap have the
;; following five functions:

(defun <mumble>-display (<mumble>)
